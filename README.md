# VGS simple integration

Here are the files needed to show a simple VGS integration. They contain two forms,and one testing script

1- Sends the credit information to the inbound route to encrypt 3 fields (card num, exp date, cvv). This will generate a json output data in json format

2- Sends the json generated by the previous form, to reveal the data that comes out of the oubound route, being pinged back by https://echo.apps.verygood.systemsâ€‹ 

3- A test.py was included to show another outbound route that sends the clear data back to a flask server, using ngrok address and showing the post data on the flask logs, and also filtered the post output.
